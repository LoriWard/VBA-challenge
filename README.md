VBA Homework - The VBA of Wall Street
Background

In this homework assignment, I used VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data.


I created a script that looped through all the stocks for one year and will output the following information:


- The ticker symbol.

- Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

- The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

- The total stock volume of the stock.

I also added conditional formatting that highlights positive change in green and negative change in red.

I made the appropriate adjustments to the VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.




Includes a screen shot for each year of the  results on the Multi Year Stock Data and VBA Scripts as separate files.
